# Harness scorecard: is the harness getting better?

A short, fixed set of tasks you can run by hand on any build, and the
numbers to write down each time. Run it before and after a change and put
the two rows side by side. This is not the benchmark track
(`docs/bench/2026-09-baseline.md`); it is the everyday gauge.

## The numbers, and what "better" means

| Number | Where it comes from | Better is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tokens in / out per turn | the usage ledger (`Settings → Usage`, or `/api/usage`, or `<data>/usage/YYYY-MM.jsonl`) | lower, for the same task done correctly |
| Cached input | same row; the part of "in" the provider re-read from its cache | higher share of "in" on the second and later turns of a thread |
| Cost | same row, as the engine reports it (subscription engines report what it *would* bill) | lower |
| Wall time per turn | a stopwatch, or the `Wall s` column of the script | lower, especially on follow-up turns |
| Steps | tool chips under the reply (needs Settings → Appearance → **Tool calls** on) | fewer for the same result; not zero |
| Correct | did the reply do what was asked (the tasks below have a yes/no check) | yes, always; a cheaper wrong answer is worse |
| Evidence coverage (Phase 0+) | `/api/metrics` → `coverage`; `full` means the harness saw the whole tool result | more `full` |
| Stable-prefix changes (Phase 0+) | `/api/metrics` → `stablePrefixChanges` | lower; each one is a cache miss |

Rule of thumb: compare **the same task, on the same engine and model, on the
same day**. Providers change prices and prompts; the harness is only the part
you can hold still.

## The tasks (run all four, in this order)

Open the app under test, create a fresh bot per task so threads do not mix,
and turn on **Settings → Appearance → Tool calls** so you can count steps.

**T1 — file task (one turn).** Send:
> Create a file called scorecard.txt in your working folder containing
> exactly three lines: alpha, beta, gamma. Then list the folder with ls.
> Reply in one short sentence.

Correct when the reply names `scorecard.txt`. Expect two tool chips. Write
down: in, out, cached, cost, wall time, steps.

**T2 — three follow-ups (one thread, three turns).** New bot. Send, one
after the other, waiting for each reply:
> What is 17 + 25? Reply with the number only.
> Add 10 to that. Reply with the number only.
> Subtract 2 from that. Reply with the number only.

Correct: 42, 52, 50. Write down the numbers for each turn. Turns 2 and 3 are
where a harness that keeps the engine process alive and its prompt stable
shows up: cached input should be most of "in", and wall time should be
lower than turn 1.

**T3 — a big tool result (one turn).** New bot. Send:
> Using one shell loop, write a file named log.txt with 200 lines of the
> form 'line N' (N from 1 to 200). Then print the whole file with cat. Then
> tell me how many lines it has, in one short sentence.

Correct when the reply says 200. On Phase 0 with a Claude bot, open the
`cat` chip: the full 200 lines are there, not a preview, and
`/api/metrics` counts the turn under `coverage.full`.

**T4 — another engine takes over (one turn).** Go back to T1's bot, change
that task's engine (task settings) to a different signed-in engine, then send:
> Which file did you create earlier in this conversation, and what were its
> three lines? Answer in one short sentence without running any tools.

Correct when the reply says `alpha`. This is the "done when" of Phase 0: the
new engine is told what the old one *did* (the digest), not only what it
said.

## Doing it unattended

The script runs exactly the four tasks above and prints the same table:

```sh
# 1. start the build's harness standalone on its own port and data folder
#    (the desktop app refuses scripted sends, on purpose)
OMB_DATA_DIR=$HOME/.openmausbot-score OMB_PORT=28801 \
  node --experimental-strip-types server/index.ts &

# 2. run the scorecard (Claude for T1–T3, Codex takes over for T4)
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/bench/scorecard.ts \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:28801 --data-dir $HOME/.openmausbot-score \
  --label phase0 --engine claude --switch-to codex --out /tmp/score-phase0.json
```

Run it once per build you want to compare (a worktree at `main`, a worktree
at the branch), each with its own port and data folder, and paste the two
tables next to each other. `--engine codex --switch-to claude` runs the set
the other way round. Every turn costs real engine usage: the whole set is
six turns per run.

## Reading a comparison honestly

- One run each is a sample, not a verdict. Providers vary turn to turn by a
  few thousand tokens; look for differences that repeat.
- "In" is dominated by the system prompt and tool schemas the engine sends
  every turn. A harness change that trims the stable prompt shows as lower
  "in" on **every** turn; process reuse shows as higher **cached** on
  follow-ups; digests show as T4 turning from "no" to "yes".
- If T2's later turns are not mostly cached, something is breaking the
  prefix each turn. On Phase 0, `/api/metrics` → `stablePrefixChanges`
  names the section that moved.

## Record

Keep runs in `docs/bench/scorecard/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-<label>.md` with the
table, the engine versions (`/api/instances`), and the commit. The first
pair is `2026-09-15-main-vs-phase0.md`.
